# Project Requirement Document: Agentic PRD Generation

1.  Executive Summary
    - This document outlines the requirements for "Agentic PRD Generation" an agentic platform designed to generate high-quality Project Requirement Documents (PRDs). The system will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the PRD creation process, from outlining to final revision. It will serve developers and product managers by rapidly translating ideas into structured, actionable plans. A key feature is a real-time front-end that visualizes the agentic workflow, enhancing transparency and user engagement.

2.  Success Metrics & Evaluation
    - **Primary Metric 1: PRD Quality.** The generated PRD must score at least 4/5 on a rubric evaluating clarity, completeness, and coherence, as judged by a sample group of target users.
    - **Primary Metric 2: User Satisfaction.** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 40+ or a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of 80% among early adopters, focusing on the real-time update feature.
    - **Secondary Metric: Framework Insights.** The comparative implementation in Phase B will produce a qualitative report on the strengths and weaknesses of each agentic framework for this specific task.

3.  Functional Scope
    - **User Input:** Accept a high-level project idea as initial text input.
    - **Agentic Workflow:** Implement a multi-step process: Outline Generation → Web Research → Draft Creation → Self-Critique → Revision Loop.
    - **Framework Implementation:**
      - **Phase A:** Build the core workflow using only official `google-genai` and `openai` Python clients.
      - **Phase B:** Re-implement the workflow in separate, parallel modules using `openai-agents`, `CrewAI`, `smolagents`, `AutoGen`, `LangGraph`, `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`, and `DSPy` for comparison.
    - **Real-Time UI:** A front-end will display the current step, the full PRD content as it evolves, and a changelog/diff for each revision.
    - **Configuration:** Allow users to select the level of autonomy (e.g., "Full Autonomy" requires no intervention after initial input; "Supervised" prompts for user approval at key stages like outline completion).

4.  Non-Functional Requirements
    - **Performance:** PRD generation for a standard project should complete in under 5 minutes.
    - **Reliability:** The system must be resilient to transient API failures from LLM providers, implementing retry logic.
    - **Usability:** The front-end must be intuitive, requiring no documentation for a user to start their first PRD.
    - **Extensibility:** The architecture must allow for new agentic frameworks to be added in the future with minimal refactoring.

5.  Solution Architecture

    **5.1 Phase A – Vanilla LLM Clients**
    - A central FastAPI application will orchestrate the agentic workflow.
    - A state manager (e.g., a simple in-memory dictionary or a Redis instance) will hold the current PRD state.
    - Each step (outline, draft, critique) will be a Python function that calls the OpenAI or Google GENAI APIs and updates the state.
    - Server-Sent Events (SSE) will be used to stream state changes to the front-end.

    **5.2 Phase B – Framework Modules Comparison**
    - Each framework (`CrewAI`, `AutoGen`, etc.) will be implemented in its own isolated Python module.
    - A factory or strategy pattern will be used in the FastAPI backend to select and run the chosen framework's workflow, while maintaining the same state management and streaming interface as Phase A.

6.  Technology Stack
    - **Backend:** FastAPI, Python 3.11+
    - **LLM Clients:** `openai`, `google-genai`
    - **Agentic Frameworks:**
      - [openai-agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)
      - [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
      - [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)
      - [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)
      - [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
      - [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
      - [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
      - [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

    - **Front-end:** Streamlit. Its native components for status updates and text display are well-suited for the real-time requirements, offering the fastest path to a minimal, effective UI.
    - **Streaming & State Mgmt:** FastAPI Server-Sent Events (SSE) with a simple in-memory state store for the initial local version.

7.  Agentic Workflow Spec
    1.  **Outline:** An agent generates a PRD outline based on the user's input. Exits when the structure matches the required template.
    2.  **Research (Optional):** An agent performs targeted web searches to gather data for ambiguous sections. Tool: `web_search`. Exits after collecting sufficient information or hitting a time limit.
    3.  **Draft:** An agent populates the outline to create the first PRD draft. Exits when all sections are filled.
    4.  **Critique & Revise Loop:** A critique agent reviews the draft against acceptance criteria (e.g., clarity, guardrails). A revision agent implements the suggested changes. The loop continues until the critique agent finds no further issues.
    - **Guardrails:** Implement input/output filtering to prevent harmful content generation. Ensure relevance by checking if the generated content deviates from the initial project scope. Provide a "stop" button for the user to halt the process at any time.

8.  UI Wireframe Outline
    - **Single-Page Application:**
      - **Input Area (Top):** A text box for the initial project idea and a "Generate PRD" button.
      - **Configuration Panel (Sidebar):** Radio buttons to select the autonomy level and the desired framework (Phase A/B).
      - **Status Display (Main Content Area):** Shows the current active step (e.g., "Status: Drafting...").
      - **PRD Display (Main Content Area):** A formatted text area showing the latest version of the PRD, updated in real-time.
      - **Changelog (Main Content Area):** A collapsible section showing a diff of changes between the last revision and the current one.

9.  MVP Milestones & Timeline
    - **Week 1:** Setup FastAPI backend with SSE streaming and a basic Streamlit front-end. Implement Phase A workflow with mock LLM calls.
    - **Week 2:** Integrate actual `openai` and `google-genai` clients into the Phase A workflow.
    - **Week 3:** Build the first comparative module for Phase B (e.g., `CrewAI`).
    - **Week 4:** Build the remaining Phase B modules and finalize the UI for comparison and real-time updates.

10. Risks & Mitigations
    - **Risk: Inconsistent LLM Output.** LLMs may produce varied or low-quality results.
        - **Mitigation:** Implement a strong critique/revision loop and use temperature settings to control creativity.
    - **Risk: Scope Creep.** The comparison of many frameworks could delay the project.
        - **Mitigation:** Strictly time-box the implementation for each framework in Phase B.
    - **Risk: Complex State Management.** Real-time state synchronization can become complex.
        - **Mitigation:** Start with a simple in-memory store and SSE. Avoid more complex solutions like WebSockets or dedicated state libraries unless proven necessary.
